ABOUT ME

       Hi!! My name is Lucciana (loo-chee-ah-nuh) and I am a 22-year-old independent, licensed tattoo artist based in NYC. Art has been my lifelong interest, and I'm so happy to be able to share this passion through my tattoo work. My work is mostly centered around realism in the forms of dot work, and recently I have been leaning more towards fine lines and black and grey micro-realism tattoos. 

​

 Similar to my personal style, whether it be: clothing, artwork, music, or interior design - I rarely love only one style at once. Therefore, I love exploring different tattoo designs, styles, and techniques.   I'm beyond grateful to be a part of these personal expressions through body art and I’m so excited to collaborate with you!

​

On this website, you will find information about how to book, my policies, pricing, and aftercare tips!

​

Thanks for visiting:)

​

Love,
Lucciana
